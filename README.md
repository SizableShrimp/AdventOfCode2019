# AdventOfCode2019
This repository will hold my solutions for [Advent Of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
These are by no means the "best" or "fastest" solutions out there. These are just my attempt at the challenge.
I may add proper benchmarking at a later date if I feel like it.

### Information About Data Reader
This program can optionally read input data for a specified day **directly from the Advent Of Code servers**.
To enable this feature, an environment variable named "AOC_SESSION" must be set.
It should hold your session cookie for Advent Of Code website, which can be found with browser inspection.
If input data is successfully retrieved from the servers, this data is cached in a text file relative to your run directory.

Fetching data from the Advent Of Code servers is **only** used if a file with the input data for a specified day cannot be found.
See the code documentation for more detail.
